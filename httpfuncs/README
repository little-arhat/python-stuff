1. This project provides a web service.
  a. The web service accepts a number, n, as input and returns the first n Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0. I.e. given n = 5, appropriate output would represent the sequence "0 1 1 2 3".
  b. Given a negative number, it will respond with an appropriate error.

2. To run it, use python3: ./httpfuncs.py <bind-host> <bind-port>.
